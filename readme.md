# 3DYolo2
A convolutional neural network approach for 3D images

Original 2D package from https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo2

Aim of the project:

We setup a automated recognition of dendritic spines. Spines are protusions of the dendrite of a neuron that receive inputs through the synapse at their heads. Using fluorescence microscopy one can visualize the dendritic structure from living neurons in three dimensions. The picture below shows the isosurfaces of the fluoresence level. Spines are shown by green boxes.
