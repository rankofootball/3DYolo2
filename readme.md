# 3DYolo2
A convolutional neural network approach for 3D images

Original 2D package from https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo2

Aim of the project:

We setup an automated recognition of dendritic spines. Spines are protusions of the dendrite of a neuron that receive inputs through the synapse at their head. Using fluorescence microscopy one can visualize the dendritic structure from living neurons in three dimensions. The picture below shows the isosurfaces of the fluoresence level (gray and red surfaces). Spines are shown by green boxes.
